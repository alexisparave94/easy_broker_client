## Notes

- Due to I worked with a third party service (EasyBroker API), I didnÂ´t have models to work with, so I have to use POROS (Plain Old Ruby Objects), it was a solution that I found in order to use OOP. 

- I decided to use only a class for services because there was only 2 entities (property and contact), but it could be improved by creating a class for each one.

- It was a litle challenge, but I create my own pagination to take advantage of that EasyBroker API gives the list of properties per page, I'm not sure where I can put this code, it's one area I think is not clean. I could also improve the pagination so that it only shows a certain amount of pages and not all.

- It is really interesting to work in test with a third party service, you have to take in count a lot of drawbacks, I like how VCR gem helps to solve some of them.
